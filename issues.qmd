My commitment is to address the key issues facing our schools with thoughtful consideration and a focus on what's best for our students.

## Fiscal Responsibility

Our district faces significant budget challenges, and we must approach them with transparency and data-driven decision-making. My experience in research and data analysis will be invaluable in ensuring that every dollar spent directly benefits our students' educational experience. We will prioritize maintaining essential programs and personnel, while exploring innovative solutions to optimize resource allocation and improve operational efficiencies. We must be thoughtful stewards of taxpayer dollars, focusing on long-term sustainability and the highest return on educational investment. I will work to ensure that any necessary cuts are made strategically, minimizing impact on student learning and maximizing equitable access to educational opportunities.

## Improving Communication and Transparency

Effective communication and transparency are vital for a strong school community. I will advocate for proactive, open dialogue between the Board, administration, teachers, parents, and students. We need to establish clear, accessible channels for sharing information about district policies, budget decisions, and academic progress. I will work to ensure that Board meetings are informative and accessible, and that community feedback is actively sought and valued. Building trust through clear and consistent communication is essential for fostering a collaborative and supportive learning environment.

## Academic Statement

Our academic focus must be on providing a rigorous, well-rounded education that prepares all students for success in high school and beyond. I am committed to a curriculum that emphasizes critical thinking, problem-solving, and a deep understanding of core subjects. I will support the district's efforts to align curriculum from Kindergarten through 8th grade, focusing on evidence-based practices and data-driven improvements. I will champion the articulation of curriculum and expectations with Rumson and RFH, ensuring a seamless transition for our students. Furthermore, I will prioritize professional development for our teachers, enabling them to provide differentiated instruction and support all learners, including mid-tier students and those with unique needs. We must foster a culture of continuous improvement, driven by data and a commitment to excellence.

## Extracurricular Statement

Extracurricular activities and a positive school climate are essential for the social, emotional, and behavioral development of our students. I believe in fostering an inclusive environment that supports the whole child, promoting well-being and a sense of belonging. I will advocate for programs that encourage teamwork, leadership, and personal growth, ensuring that all students have opportunities to participate and thrive. We must prioritize the health, wellness, and safety of our students, providing resources and support to address their social and emotional needs.
