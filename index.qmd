Welcome to my campaign website! I'm Peter M. Crosta, and I'm running for the [Fair Haven Board of Education](https://www.fairhaven.edu/district/board_of_education) in 2025 because I believe in a **data-driven, outcome-oriented** approach to ensuring the best possible education for all Fair Haven students.

Born and raised in New Jersey, I spent formative summers on the Bayshore before making Fair Haven home in 2021 with my wife, Sarah, and our two children (ages 4 and 7), a rising Kindergartner and a 2nd grader at Sickles Elementary School. I have expertise in educational evaluation and policy analysis, having earned a PhD in economics of education from Columbia University, and I spent a decade conducting research on higher-ed institutions serving diverse student populations. My vision for Fair Haven schools is to ensure every child has access to a high-quality education that prepares them for success in a rapidly-changing world. My research has given me a deep understanding of resource allocation challenges in educational settings, which will be invaluable in addressing Fair Haven's budget constraints and ensuring all students have the support they need. Beyond my professional experience, I also volunteer on the board of Fair Haven Rec Soccer. When not enjoying the beach with my family or watching the kids play soccer at Fair Haven fields, I work as a user experience researcher for a global technology company.
