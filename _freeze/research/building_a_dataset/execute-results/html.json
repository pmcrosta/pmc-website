Crosta\"\nformat:\n  html:\n    code-fold: true\n    df-print: paged\n    code-overflow: scroll\n---\n\n\n\n# Introduction\n\nTo gain a better understanding of the current state of education in Fair Haven, I started by building a data set. This document shares the process I went through to combine state and federal resources to generate data sets that ultimately would enable the following:\n\n-   Creation of a set of suitable comparison school districts for Fair Haven\n\n-   An analysis of student outcomes, educational inputs, and their relationship over time\n\nIn an effort to be as transparent as possible, this document will contain descriptions of source and derived data sets as well as code in the R programming language that one can use to reproduce results.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n# ACS EDGE\n\nACS EDGE, or the American Community Survey (ACS) [Education Demographic and Geographic Estimates (EDGE)](https://nces.ed.gov/programs/edge/Demographic/ACS), data contains district-level social, economic, housing, and demographic detail based on the ACS 5-year summary files. The latest available data was the [2018-22](https://nces.ed.gov/programs/edge/TableViewer/acsProfile/2022) data, and we use the Population Group: Total Population. The raw data that was downloaded from ACS came as zipped XLSX files. The zip files were uploaded to a Google Drive folder, where they could be accessed and parsed.\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n\n\n\n",
