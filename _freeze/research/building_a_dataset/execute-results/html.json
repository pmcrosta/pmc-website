This document shares the process I went through to combine state and federal resources to generate data sets that ultimately would enable the following:\n\n-   Creation of a set of suitable comparison school districts for Fair Haven\n-   An analysis of student outcomes, educational inputs, and their relationship over time\n\nIn an effort to be as transparent as possible, this document will contain descriptions of source and derived data sets as well as code in the R programming language that one can use to reproduce results.\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code  code-summary=\"Code - Load libraries\"}\noptions(width = 120)\n\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(readxl)\nlibrary(googlesheets4)\nlibrary(googledrive)\nlibrary(haven)\nlibrary(cluster)\nlibrary(MASS)\nlibrary(ggpmisc)\nlibrary(ggrepel)\nlibrary(ggfortify)\nlibrary(glue)\nlibrary(DT)\nlibrary(htmltools)\nlibrary(factoextra)\nlibrary(gt)\n\nset.seed(2024)\n\n# Commonly used State ID numbers (staid) and Federal Local Education Authority (LEA) IDs\n# for FH, Little Silver, Rumson, and Shrewsbury\nfh_leaid <- \"3404950\"\nfh_staid <- \"NJ-251440\"\n\nls_leaid <- \"3408790\"\nls_staid <- \"NJ-252720\"\n\nrums_leaid <- \"3414370\"\nrums_staid <- \"NJ-254570\"\n\nshrews_leaid <- \"3414970\"\nshrews_staid <- \"NJ-254770\"\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n# Common Core of Data\n\nThe first data set I leverage is the [Common Core of Data](https://nces.ed.gov/ccd/files.asp#Fiscal:2,LevelId:5,Page:1), a directory of PK-12 schools curated by the Federal Government. The most recent data is specific to the 2023-24 school year, which is suitable for the purpose of building a directory of public, non-charter NJ districts that that offer grades PK/K-8 like Fair Haven.\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code  code-summary=\"Code - Read Common Core of Data\"}\nurl <- \"https://nces.ed.gov/ccd/Data/zip/ccd_lea_029_2324_w_0a_050824.zip\"\n\ntemp_file <- tempfile(fileext = \".zip\") \ndownload.file(url, destfile = temp_file, mode = \"wb\") \nout <- unzip(temp_file, exdir = tempdir())\n\noutcsv <- grep(pattern=\"csv$\", x = out, value = T) \nccd <- read_csv(outcsv)\n\n# Create subset of public NJ K-8\nccdnjk12 <- ccd  %>%  \n  dplyr::filter(ST==\"NJ\", LEA_TYPE==1, CHARTER_LEA==\"NOTCHR\") %>% \n  dplyr::filter(G_9_OFFERED==\"No\", G_10_OFFERED==\"No\", G_11_OFFERED==\"No\", G_12_OFFERED==\"No\", G_13_OFFERED==\"No\") %>% \n  dplyr::filter(GSLO != \"05\", !

These are saved as [RDS](datasets/ccdnjk12.rds) or [CSV](datasets/ccdnjk12.csv) files for easy access.\n\n<details>\n\n<summary>Click to show/hide table of

(EDGE)](https://nces.ed.gov/programs/edge/Demographic/ACS), data contains district-level social, economic, housing, and demographic detail based on the ACS 5-year summary files. I use this data to generate peer districts (comparison groups) for Fair Haven. The latest available data was the [2018-22](https://nces.ed.gov/programs/edge/TableViewer/acsProfile/2022) data, and I use the Population Group: Total Population. The raw data that was downloaded from ACS came as zipped XLSX files. The zip files were uploaded to a Google Drive folder, where they could be accessed and parsed.

Generating Peer Districts\n\nThe main purpose of collecting the ACS-EDGE data is to generate a set of districts that can help us to understand trends in Fair Haven and not in isolation. Due to geographical proximity and social integration, the *de facto* peer group for Fair Haven has mostly consisted of Rumson Borough, Little Silver Borough, and Shrewsbury Borough. I will certainly be highlighting these districts as we proceed. However, it is also instructive to have a broader set of districts that serve a population that is similar to Fair Haven along numerous demographic characteristics. I use the ACS-EDGE data to generate such a set of districts.\n\n::: callout-note\n## Why not use District Factor Groups?\n\nFor years, people have used [District Factor Groups](https://nj.gov/education/finance/rda/dfg.shtml) (DFGs) for the purpose of comparing students’ performance on statewide assessments across demographically similar school districts. However, the School Performance Reports no longer compare districts using this measure, and no updates have been made to the DFGs since the groupings were finalized in 2004.\n:::\n\n## Approaches\n\nI leverage a number of techniques to generate peer districts for Fair Haven using these data. This exercise is both an art and science, as it is both grounded in data and subject to a number of researcher choices. To that end, a few sets of comparison districts will be created. Note that the final comparison data sets will be filtered to only include PK-8 districts like Fair Haven; this will happen later though since it requires yet another data source. In addition, the following section is not a \"full academic\" treatment of these approaches, meaning that the primary end is to be useful, not necessarily to fully account for all methodological nuances. However, I will compare district characteristics across various peer sets.\n\n### Euclidean distance\n\nOne simple, albeit somewhat naive, approach to identifying peer districts is to find the districts that are \"closest\" to each other given the district characteristics that were identified above. To do this, I\n\n1.  Standardize all of our variables\n2.  Compute a distance matrix (Euclidean distance in multidimensional space)\n3.  Rank districts in terms of their \"proximity\" to Fair Haven\n\nOne downside to this strategy is that there are a number of highly correlated variables in the data set, and the distance matrix may overweight importance of these characteristics. For example, there are a number of income-based measures, and thus this approach may over-index on the household incomes of district residents. However, it may also produce a reasonable peer set.\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code  code-summary=\"Code - Using Euclidean distance\"}\n# Standardize variables\nedge_df_scale <-

Principal Components\n\nAnother strategy for identifying peer districts is a dimensionality reduction technique called Principal Components Analysis. This is actually the same technique used to develop the original District Factor Groups. Though here I am using more data and more recent data. The central idea is to reduce our 40-dimensional (40-column) data set into a smaller set of components (or dimensions) that are maximally different from each other and uncorrelated with each other. These new components would contain the essence of the larger set of columns. As in the DFG calculation, I expect the first principal component to contain the variance associated with socioeconomic status (SES).\n\nThe general procedure is to:\n\n1.  Compute the principal components on the data set\n2.  Assess which dimensions load in which principal components\n3.  Rank order component of interest, and find districts surrounding Fair Haven\n\nIf the first one or two components is not sufficient, we are in clustering territory, which will be addressed later.\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code  code-summary=\"Code - Using Principal Components\"}\n# Perform PCA\npcadat <- na.omit(edge_df[,-c(1:3)])\nrownames(pcadat) <- make.unique(na.omit(edge_df)$Geography)\npca_result <- prcomp(pcadat, scale.=T, center = T)\n\n#round(pca_result$sdev^2/sum(pca_result$sdev^2), 2) #first two ~49% variance, 37+12\n\n# Extract principal components\npc_all_scores <- pca_result$x\n\n#Visualize the reduced data\n#autoplot(pca_result, data = pcadat, label = TRUE, label.size = 3)\n\n# Get loadings\npca_loadings <- pca_result$rotation\n\n# Transform loadings into a long format data frame\nloadings_df <- as.data.frame(pca_loadings)\nloadings_df$Variable <- rownames(pca_loadings)\nloadings_long <- reshape2::melt(loadings_df, id.vars = \"Variable\", variable.name = \"PC\", value.name = \"Loading\")\n```\n:::\n\n\n\nIn @fig-pca, it is clear that Component 1 (PC1) is loading on income and education dimensions, which are qualitatively aligned with SES. However, Component 2 (PC2) is loading on other potentially relevant dimensions, such as family size and the population under 18. Note the differences below in the districts that surround Fair Haven for both PC1 and PC2.\n\n::: panel-tabset\n#### PCA Heatmap\n\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n#

Cluster analysis leverages distance functions to separate districts based on similarity, with the goal of creating groups of high similarity *within* clusters and high dissimilarity *between* clusters. I will explore both K-means and hierarchical clustering techniques, looking at a few examples of each.\n\n#### K-means clusters\n\nK-means clustering requires a distance matrix as input, and we have already created Euclidean and Mahalanobis distance matrices. We can also apply distance calculations to the PCA results in order to generate clusters based on the reduced dimensionality provided by principal components. Both scaled and un-scaled PCA results are clustered. The un-scaled version should over-weight PC1, and the scaled version should treat PC1 and PC2 more equally. The tabs below show the resulting peer groups from a standard K-means routine that assumes 7 clusters (a full treatment of K-means that searches for the optimal number of clusters is omitted in this document). Each tab includes a list of districts that were clustered alongside Fair Haven given the particular distance matrix as input.\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code  code-summary=\"Code - K-means

strategy is called Hierarchical Clustering, which generates a full tree of districts based on similarity. One advantage of this technique is that one does not have to determine *a priori* how many clusters there are in the data. The tree can be cut at any level in order to find clusters of appropriate size.\n\nAs with K-means, the input to the hierarchical clustering routine is a distance matrix. There is another parameter included in the model to instruct how the clustering algorithm should combine districts with each other and with groups. This is often called the \"method\", and here will explore a few methods. Again as with K-means, a full treatment of cluster analysis is not provided here. Rather, this exercise is to generate candidate sets of peers that will be qualitatively assessed in the next section.\n\nThe first tab below shows a partial dendrogram highlighting part of the full tree that contains a decent-sized cluster around Fair Haven.

created a number of candidate peer groups for Fair Haven. In fact, there are 14 possible sets to choose from (probably too many!):\n\n-   Distance-based (pick districts closest to Fair Haven according to a distance metric)\n    -   Euclidean `euclid_score`\n    -   Mahalanobis `mah_score`\n-   Principal Components (pick districts according to similarity across a reduced dimensional space)\n    -   PC1 `PC1`\n    -   PC2 `PC2`\n-   K-means Clusters (pick districts based on groups derived from the K-means algorithm.\n    -   Euclidean distance `km_euclid`\n    -   Mahalanobis distance `km_maha`\n    -   First two principal components (scaled) `km_pc_scaled`\n    -   First two principal components (unscaled) `km_pc_unscaled`\n-   Hierarchical Clusters\n    -   Euclidean - Ward `hc_euclid_ward`\n    -   Euclidean - WPGMA `hc_euclid_mcquitty`\n    -   PC Scaled - Ward `hc_pc_dist_scaled_ward`\n    -   PC Scaled - WPGMA `hc_pc_dist_scaled_mcquitty`\n    -   PC Unscaled - Ward `hc_pc_dist_unscaled_ward`\n    -   PC Unscaled - WPGMA `hc_pc_dist_unscaled_mcquitty`\n\nThe table below summarizes a selection of district characteristics for the districts that are included in each potential peer set. Fair Haven itself is included in the last row for comparison. The `Peninsula` column is TRUE if FH, Rumson, Little Silver, and Shrewsbury are all included in that particular peer set.\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code  code-summary=\"Code - Compare peer
