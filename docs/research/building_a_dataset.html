<h1>Introduction</h1>
<p>To gain a better understanding of the current state of education in Fair Haven, I started by building a data set. This document shares the process I went through to combine state and federal resources to generate data sets that ultimately would enable the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Creation of a set of suitable comparison school districts for Fair Haven</li>
<li>An analysis of student outcomes, educational inputs, and their relationship over time</li>
</ul>
<p>In an effort to be as transparent as possible, this document will contain descriptions of source and derived data sets as well as code in the R programming language that one can use to reproduce results.</p>

<h1>ACS EDGE</h1>
<p>ACS EDGE, or the American Community Survey (ACS) <a href="https://nces.ed.gov/programs/edge/Demographic/ACS">Education Demographic and Geographic Estimates (EDGE)</a>, data contains district-level social, economic, housing, and demographic detail based on the ACS 5-year summary files. I use this data to generate peer districts (comparison groups) for Fair Haven. The latest available data was the <a href="https://nces.ed.gov/programs/edge/TableViewer/acsProfile/2022">2018-22</a> data, and I use the Population Group: Total Population. The raw data that was downloaded from ACS came as zipped XLSX files. The zip files were uploaded to a Google Drive folder, where they could be accessed and parsed. The collapsed code chunk below creates data frames from the raw ACS EDGE data.</p>

<h1>Generating Peer Districts</h1>
<p>The main purpose of collecting the ACS-EDGE data is to generate a set of districts that can help us to understand trends in Fair Haven and not in isolation. Due to geographical proximity and social integration, the <em>de facto</em> peer group for Fair Haven has mostly consisted of Rumson Borough, Little Silver Borough, and Shrewsbury Borough. I will certainly be highlighting these districts as we proceed. However, it is also instructive to have a broader set of districts that serve a population that is similar to Fair Haven along numerous demographic characteristics. I use the ACS-EDGE data to generate such a set of districts.</p>

Why not use District Factor Groups?

<div class="callout-body-container callout-body">
<p>For years, people have used <a href="https://nj.gov/education/finance/rda/dfg.shtml">District Factor Groups</a> (DFGs) for the purpose of comparing students’ performance on statewide assessments across demographically similar school districts. However, the School Performance Reports no longer compare districts using this measure, and no updates have been made to the DFGs since the groupings were finalized in 2004.</p>

<section id="approaches" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="approaches">Approaches</h2>
<p>I leverage a number of techniques to generate peer districts for Fair Haven using these data. This exercise is both an art and science, as it is both grounded in data and subject to a number of researcher choices. To that end, a few sets of comparison districts will be created. Note that the final comparison data sets will be filtered to only include PK-8 districts like Fair Haven; this will happen later though since it requires yet another data source. In addition, the following section is not a “full academic” treatment of these approaches, meaning that the primary end is to be useful, not necessarily to fully account for all methodological nuances. However, I will compare district characteristics across various peer sets.</p>
<section id="euclidean-distance" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="euclidean-distance">Euclidean distance</h3>
<p>One simple, albeit somewhat naive, approach to identifying peer districts is to find the districts that are “closest” to each other given the district characteristics that were identified above. To do this, I</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Standardize all of our variables</li>
<li>Compute a distance matrix (Euclidean distance in multidimensional space)</li>
<li>Rank districts in terms of their “proximity” to Fair Haven</li>
</ol>
<p>One downside to this strategy is that there are a number of highly correlated variables in the data set, and the distance matrix may overweight importance of these characteristics. For example, there are a number of income-based measures, and thus this approach may over-index on the household incomes of district residents. However, it may also produce a reasonable peer set.</p>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="mahalanobis-distance">Mahalanobis distance</h3>
<p>A second smiple distance-based approach is to use the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mahalanobis_distance">Mahalanobis</a> distance, as it is capable of taking into coniderations the correlations present in the data set. To do this, I</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Standardize all of our variables</li>
<li>Compute a distance matrix (Euclidean distance in multidimensional space)</li>
<li>Rank districts in terms of their “proximity” to Fair Haven</li>
</ol>
<p>One downside to this strategy is that there are a number of highly correlated variables in the data set, and the distance matrix may overweight importance of these characteristics. For example, there are a number of income-based measures, and thus this approach may over-index on the household incomes of district residents. However, it may also produce a reasonable peer set.</p>
