    "text": "We moved to Fair Haven in early 2021 during the Pandemic in search of a family-oriented community down the shore with excellent schools and in commuting distance to NYC. Fair Haven certainly fit the bill. Fast forward a few years and we are fully integrated into the FH community, with a first grader and pre-K-er both at Sickles.\nProfessionally, I spent the first half of my career working in education and related industries. During college, I worked as a research assistant at the Cornell Higher Education Research Institute (CHERI) studying determinants of faculty productivity. Shortly after, I spent a year at a policy evaluation firm measuring the impacts of federally funded early childhood centers. I then entered graduate school at Teachers College, Columbia University to pursue a degree in economics and education while working at the Community College Research Center (CCRC). A few years in, I decided that I needed some more grounded experience, and took two years off to be a mathematics and statistics teacher at a growing American school in Cancún, Mexico. I eventually returned to New York City and Columbia to finish graduate school before venturing out into the world of EdTech, where I worked as a researcher and data scientist at several startups. I’ve since left the education world professionally, but am still focused on research, data, and decision-making as a quantitative user experience researcher at a global technology company.\nAs I have been following the current Fair Haven district budget situation, and thinking about the long-term investments that me and my family are making in the community, it seemed like a natural next step to get more involved and to contribute a data-drive, outcome-oriented voice to these important issues facing our community and schools. It’s almost as if I have been preparing my whole life for this opportunity, and I am excited to get started.\nFor more info, check out my resume or Google Scholar profile."

    "text": "Welcome to my campaign website! I’m Peter M. Crosta, and I’m running for the Fair Haven Board of Education in 2025 because I believe in a data-driven, outcome-oriented approach to ensuring the best possible education for all Fair Haven students.\n[photo coming!]\nBorn and raised in New Jersey, I spent formative summers on the Bayshore before making Fair Haven home in 2021 with my wife, Sarah, and our two children (ages 4 and 7) who are currently enrolled at Sickles Elementary School. I have expertise in educational evaluation and policy analysis, having earned a PhD in economics of education from Columbia University, and I spent a decade conducting research on higher-ed institutions serving diverse student populations. My vision for Fair Haven schools is to ensure every child has access to a high-quality education that prepares them for success in a rapidly changing world. My research has given me a deep understanding of resource allocation challenges in educational settings, which will be invaluable in addressing Fair Haven’s budget constraints and ensuring all students have the support they need. Beyond my professional experience, I also volunteer on the board of Fair Haven Rec Soccer. When not enjoying the beach with my family or watching the kids play soccer at Fair Haven fields, I work as a user experience researcher for a global technology company."
