    "text": "This document contains comparative data on educational inputs and outcomes for Fair Haven and peer districts. In an effort to learn more about education in Fair Haven and how it compares to peer districts, I started building a data set and creating lots of graphs, many of which are reproduced on this page. The focus is on educational inputs and outcomes that live in data sets available to the public. This is to say that there are, of course, a number of inputs and outcomes that are not captured here, and thus this is a very incomplete picture of any educational process. What we can measure or what available measurements we have are not always the measurements that we might want or measurements at the right granularity. But we press on. Inputs include items such as teacher characteristics, student characteristics, and expenditures. Outcomes here are primarily oriented around standardized test scores.\nRather than commenting on every graph on this page, I have compiled a list of “things I have learned” combing through the data.\n\n\n\nCompared to peers, Fair Haven had a relatively low total per-pupil expenditure in 2023-24 (Figure 1). At face value, it is not obvious as to whether this is a positive or negative, something to champion or a concern. Fair Haven spent about $5,000 less per student than Little Silver, and one could easily imagine what an extra $5k could purchase.\nTotal expenditure includes a number of costs that may not be so tightly associated with educational products, and so I also look at per-pupil expenditures on instruction (Figure 2). Here we see Fair Haven again had a relatively lower per-pupil expenditure, though the delta between Fair Haven and our geographic neighbors was only about $1,000. Related, Fair Haven had nearly the highest percentage of expenditures going to instruction. (Figure 4)\nNotably, Fair Haven had the lowest administrative cost per student out of the entire peer set (Figure 3). Related, Fair Haven had among the highest student-admin ratios, or a high number of students per administrator (Figure 6).\n\n\n\n\n\nLooking at teachers, Fair Haven had one of the youngest teacher work forces in terms of years of experience (Figure 7).\nHistorically, Fair Haven has had challenges with chronic absences, but in the 2023-24 school year, the chronic absence percentage was nearly the same as our geographic neighbors, 4.8%. (Figure 11)\nAlso historically, or at least anecdotally, Fair Haven has had a relatively large proportion of students classified as “with disabilities”, which broadly includes any students with IEPs (Individualized Education Plans). As seen in (Figure 12), Fair Haven is about in the middle of the peer group with 15.6% of students receiving special education.\n\n\n\n\n\nMost districts in the peer group had at least 70% of students meeting or exceeding expectations in Math according to state standardized tests in grades 3-8, with Fair Haven in the middle 3rd of the pack at 78.3% (Figure 13). Rumson and Little Silver had over 86% of students meet or exceed expectations in Math (these are among the highest in the state).\nIn Math, Fair Haven had a median student growth percentile (SGP) of 55. SGP is a hard-to-interpret measure of academic progress from one year to the next, and 55 is considered typical. Rumson’s SGP was 53 and Little Silver’s was 70. (Figure 15)\nWhen excluding students with disabilities, rates of meeting or exceeding expectations in Math for all districts increased. Fair Haven and geographic peers were all about 85%. (Figure 16).\nWhen restricting to students with disabilities, about 43% Fair Haven students met or exceeded expectations in Math, compared to about 55% in Rumson (Figure 17).\nOver time, Fair Haven showed steep improvement in Math from 2014-15 to 2018-19 before dipping and remaining flat after the Covid-19 pandemic. Note that the earliest part of this time series (2014-15) was when the state replaced the NJASK test with the PARCC test. Districts that were ill-prepared for the change generally saw low test scores in the early days. In 2018-19 the NJSLA replaced PARCC (though NJSLA is similar to PARCC). (Figure 18)\n\n\n\n\n\nFor ELA (English Language Arts), most districts in the peer group had at least 77% of students meeting or exceeding expectations according to state standardized tests in grades 3-8, with Fair Haven in the middle 3rd of the pack at 81.9% (Figure 19)\nWhen excluding students with disabilities, rates of meeting or exceeding expectations in ELA for all districts increased. Fair Haven had 91% meet or exceed in ELA. (Figure 22)\nWhen restricting to students with disabilities, about 41% Fair Haven students met or exceeded expectations in ELA, compared to about 65% in Little Silver (Figure 23)\nOver time, Fair Haven showed steep improvement in ELA from 2014-15 to 2018-19 before dipping and remaining flat after the Covid-19 pandemic. (Figure 24)\n\n\n\n\n\nRelationships between outcomes (like Math and ELA achievement) and inputs (like expenditures per pupil) often show weak positive relationships, which is not unexpected. One reason to examine this relationship between only Fair Haven and similar peers is to compare like with like as best as possible and reduce biases coming from unmeasured or omitted factors (Figure 25 and Figure 37).\nOne relationship that is particularly strong is between district median family income and Math and ELA achievement (Figure 27 and Figure 39). I find these relationships to be a clear reminder of the socioeconomic diversity present in our State as well as the privilege that many of us share in the Peninsula area.\nAnother relationship that stood out to me was between chronic absence and achievement. Figure 35 and Figure 47 show the negative relationship between chronic absence and Math and ELA achievement. Figure 36 and Figure 48 shows it for all districts.\n\n\n\n\nIn 2023-24, Fair Haven spent less per student overall and on instruction compared to peers, but directed a high percentage of its budget to the classroom. It had the lowest administrative costs and a young teaching staff. Chronic absences improved to match neighbors. About 15.6% of students had disabilities, placing Fair Haven in the middle of its peer group.\nAcademic outcomes in Math (78.3%) and ELA (81.9%) were in the middle range compared to peers. Excluding students with disabilities, these rates improved significantly. However, students with disabilities showed lower achievement in both subjects than some peers. Achievement improved notably from 2014-15 to 2018-19 before leveling off post-pandemic.\nWithin the peer group, per-pupil spending had a weak link to outcomes, but median family income strongly correlated with achievement across all districts. Higher chronic absence was linked to lower Math and ELA scores.\nDespite the richness of these data, they are limited in what they reveal about the educational landscape in Fair Haven. Though I do believe that this is a decent starting point for helping folks to align on a set of facts that can lead to fruitful conversations with practitioners."

    "text": "Introduction\nStudent enrollment in a district is a core driver of the cost of delivering education, and is a core component in how some school funding, like state aid, is delivered. Across New Jersey, there have been several examples of districts that have seen declining enrollments. Most notably, our northern neighbor Middletown recently announced a provisional plan to close two elementary schools largely due to declining enrollments and increasing costs. Years of declining student counts in neighboring Rumson and Little Silver has also been noted as the primary factor behind their much higher observed spending-per-pupil than districts like Fair Haven.\nTo better understand these trends, I turn to some data on district enrollments from the NJ Department of Education. Details on the data source used can be found here. The specific questions addressed in this document include:\n\nWhat have enrollment trends looked like in Fair Haven over the past decade?\nHow have total enrollments in Fair Haven compared to peninsula districts?\nHow have total enrollments in Fair Haven compared to other similar districts?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nThis document is not meant to be an academic analysis of enrollment patterns. Rather, I wrote it to assist my own understanding of some of the issues and circumstances that impact Fair Haven schools, and as a way to understand one aspect of Fair Haven’s experience relative to peers.\n\n\n\n\nCode - Load libraries\noptions(width = 120)\n\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(cluster)\nlibrary(MASS)\nlibrary(ggpmisc)\nlibrary(ggrepel)\nlibrary(glue)\nlibrary(DT)\nlibrary(factoextra)\nlibrary(gt)\nlibrary(purrr)\n\nset.seed(2024)\n\n# Commonly used State ID numbers (staid) and Federal Local Education Authority (LEA) IDs\n# for FH, Little Silver, Rumson, and Shrewsbury\nfh_leaid &lt;- \"3404950\"\nfh_staid &lt;- \"NJ-251440\"\n\nls_leaid &lt;- \"3408790\"\nls_staid &lt;- \"NJ-252720\"\n\nrums_leaid &lt;- \"3414370\"\nrums_staid &lt;- \"NJ-254570\"\n\nshrews_leaid &lt;- \"3414970\"\nshrews_staid &lt;- \"NJ-254770\"\n\ndistrict_name_colors &lt;- c(\n  \"Fair Haven Boro\" = \"#4169E1\",\n  \"Little Silver Boro\" = \"#1F2868\",\n  \"Rumson Boro\" = \"#8640C4\",\n  \"Shrewsbury Boro\" = \"#004500\",\n  \"Other\" = \"darkgrey\"\n)\n\ndistrict_stleaid_colors &lt;-  c(\"#4169E1\", \"#1F2868\", \"#8640C4\", \"#004500\", \"lightgrey\")\nnames(district_stleaid_colors) &lt;-c(fh_staid, ls_staid, rums_staid, shrews_staid, \"Other\")\n\nknitr::opts_chunk$set(\n    fig.width = 8,    \n    fig.height = 10,\n    fig.align = \"center\"\n)\n\n\n\n\nCode - Load enrollment data\ncomb2324 &lt;- read_csv(\"datasets/comb2324.csv\")\nenr_all &lt;- read_csv(\"datasets/enr_all.csv\")\n\n# Attach peer set to enrollment data set\nenr_all$hc_euclid_ward &lt;- enr_all$ST_LEAID %in% comb2324$ST_LEAID[comb2324$hc_euclid_ward]\n\n# Set up colors\nenr_all &lt;- enr_all %&gt;%\n  dplyr::mutate(dist_colors = case_when(\n    ST_LEAID %in% names(district_stleaid_colors) ~ ST_LEAID,\n    TRUE ~ \"Other\"\n  ))\n\n\n\n\nFair Haven\n\n\nCode - Enrollment trends for FH\nenr_all %&gt;%\n  dplyr::filter(ST_LEAID==fh_staid) %&gt;%\n  \n  {\n    ggplot(data=., aes(x=SchoolYear, y=TotalEnrollment, group=ST_LEAID, color=dist_colors)) +\n             geom_line(aes(alpha = 1), linewidth = 1) +\n             geom_point(aes(alpha = 1), size = 4) +\n             scale_x_discrete(expand = c(.2, .2), labels = sort(unique(.$SchoolYear))) +\n             scale_y_continuous(n.breaks = 10) +\n             geom_point(color = \"#FFFFFF\", size = 1) +\n             geom_text(data = . %&gt;% filter(SchoolYear == \"2023-2024\"),\n             aes(label = gsub(\" School District\", \"\", DistrictName), x = 13.5) , hjust = 0.15, fontface = \"bold\", color = \"#888888\", size = 2) +\n             labs(x = \"\", y = \"\", title = \"Total Enrollments in Fair Haven\", subtitle = \"\") +\n             theme_minimal() +\n             theme(axis.text.x = element_text(size=9, vjust=1, hjust=1, color = \"black\", angle = 30)) +\n             theme(panel.grid.major.y = element_line(color=\"grey97\")) +\n             theme(panel.grid.minor.y = element_blank()) +\n             theme(panel.grid.major.x = element_line(color=\"grey97\")) +\n             theme(panel.grid.minor.x = element_blank()) +\n             scale_color_manual(values=district_stleaid_colors, guide=\"none\") +\n             scale_alpha(guide=\"none\")\n  }\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: District Enrollments for Fair Haven\n\n\n\n\n\nAs seen in Figure 1, Fair Haven has seen a general decline in total enrollments since the 2012-13 school year, from 1041 students to 956 students in 2023-24.

It is clear that, although enrollment have generally been declining in Fair Haven, the district did not see the sharper permanent declines as Peninsula Peers saw during the Covid. In addition, Fair Haven is neither rapidly growing nor shrinking like other peer districts."

    "section": "Approaches",
    "text": "Approaches\nI leverage a number of techniques to generate peer districts for Fair Haven using these data. This exercise is both an art and science, as it is both grounded in data and subject to a number of researcher choices. To that end, a few sets of comparison districts will be created. Note that the final comparison data sets will be filtered to only include PK-8 districts like Fair Haven; this will happen later though since it requires yet another data source. In addition, the following section is not a “full academic” treatment of these approaches, meaning that the primary end is to be useful, not necessarily to fully account for all methodological nuances. However, I will compare district characteristics across various peer sets.\n\nEuclidean distance\nOne simple, albeit somewhat naive, approach to identifying peer districts is to find the districts that are “closest” to each other given the district characteristics that were identified above. To do this, I\n\nStandardize all of our variables\nCompute a distance matrix (Euclidean distance in multidimensional space)\nRank districts in terms of their “proximity” to Fair Haven\n\nOne downside to this strategy is that there are a number of highly correlated variables in the data set, and the distance matrix may overweight importance of these characteristics. For example, there are a number of income-based measures, and thus this approach may over-index on the household incomes of district residents. However, it may also produce a reasonable peer set.\n\n\nCode - Using Euclidean distance\n# Standardize variables\nedge_df_scale &lt;- scale(edge_df[,-c(1:3)])\nrownames(edge_df_scale) &lt;- edge_df$LEAID\n\n## compute the distance matrix\nedge_dist &lt;- dist(edge_df_scale, method = \"euclidean\")\n\n# Find the indices of the closest districts\nclosest_indices_euclid &lt;- order(as.matrix(edge_dist)[, which(attr(edge_dist, \"Labels\")==fh_leaid)])\n\n# Reorder edge_df so the most similar districts are on top\nsimilar_districts_euclid &lt;- edge_df[closest_indices_euclid, ] %&gt;% dplyr::mutate(euclid_score=1:n()) %&gt;% dplyr::select(LEAID, Geography, euclid_score)\n\n# Print table\ndatatable(similar_districts_euclid,\n  options = list(\n    pageLength = 5,\n    searching = TRUE,\n    ordering = TRUE\n  ),\n  rownames = FALSE,\n  caption = tags$caption(\n    style = \"caption-side: top; text-align: center;\",\n    \"Most similar districts by Euclidean distance\")\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMahalanobis distance\nA second smiple distance-based approach is to use the Mahalanobis distance, as it is capable of taking into coniderations the correlations present in the data set. To do this, I\n\nStandardize all of our variables\nCompute a distance matrix (Mahalanobis pairwise distances)\nRank districts in terms of their “proximity” to Fair Haven\n\n\n\nCode - Using Mahalanobis distance\n# Standardize variables\nedge_df_scale &lt;- scale(edge_df[,-c(1:3)])\nrownames(edge_df_scale) &lt;- edge_df$LEAID\n\nmahalanobis_dist_matrix &lt;- function(data) {\n  cov_matrix &lt;- cov(data)\n  n &lt;- nrow(data)\n  dist_matrix &lt;- matrix(0, nrow = n, ncol = n)\n\n  for (i in 1:n) {\n    for (j in 1:n) {\n      dist_matrix[i, j] &lt;- mahalanobis(data[i, ], data[j, ], cov_matrix)\n    }\n  }\n  return(dist_matrix)\n}\n\n## compute the distance matrix\ndist_mat_mah &lt;- mahalanobis_dist_matrix(na.omit(edge_df_scale))\nrownames(dist_mat_mah) &lt;- dimnames(na.omit(edge_df_scale))[[1]]\n\n# Find the indices of the closest districts\nclosest_indices_mah &lt;- order(as.matrix(dist_mat_mah)[, which(rownames(dist_mat_mah)==fh_leaid)])\n\n# Print the most similar districts\nsimilar_districts_mah &lt;- (edge_df %&gt;% dplyr::filter(LEAID %in% rownames(dist_mat_mah))) [closest_indices_mah, ] %&gt;% dplyr::mutate(mah_score=1:n()) %&gt;% dplyr::select(LEAID, Geography, mah_score)\n\n# Print table\ndatatable(similar_districts_mah,\n  options = list(\n    pageLength = 5,\n    searching = TRUE,\n    ordering = TRUE\n  ),\n  rownames = FALSE,\n  caption = tags$caption(\n    style = \"caption-side: top; text-align: center;\",\n    \"Most similar districts by Mahalanobis distance\")\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrincipal Components\nAnother strategy for identifying peer districts is a dimensionality reduction technique called Principal Components Analysis. This is actually the same technique used to develop the original District Factor Groups. Though here I am using more data and more recent data. The central idea is to reduce our 40-dimensional (40-column) data set into a smaller set of components (or dimensions) that are maximally different from each other and uncorrelated with each other. These new components would contain the essence of the larger set of columns. As in the DFG calculation, I expect the first principal component to contain the variance associated with socioeconomic status (SES).\nThe general procedure is to:\n\nCompute the principal components on the data set\nAssess which dimensions load in which principal components\nRank order component of interest, and find districts surrounding Fair Haven\n\nIf the first one or two components is not sufficient, we are in clustering territory, which will be addressed later.\n\n\nCode - Using Principal Components\n# Perform PCA\npcadat &lt;- na.omit(edge_df[,-c(1:3)])\nrownames(pcadat) &lt;- make.unique(na.omit(edge_df)$Geography)\npca_result &lt;- prcomp(pcadat, scale.=T, center = T)\n\n#round(pca_result$sdev^2/sum(pca_result$sdev^2), 2) #first two ~49% variance, 37+12\n\n# Extract principal components\npc_all_scores &lt;- pca_result$x\n\n#Visualize the reduced data\n#autoplot(pca_result, data = pcadat, label = TRUE, label.size = 3)\n\n# Get loadings\npca_loadings &lt;- pca_result$rotation\n\n# Transform loadings into a long format data frame\nloadings_df &lt;- as.data.frame(pca_loadings)\nloadings_df$Variable &lt;- rownames(pca_loadings)\nloadings_long &lt;- reshape2::melt(loadings_df, id.vars = \"Variable\", variable.name = \"PC\", value.name = \"Loading\")\n\n\nIn Figure 1, it is clear that Component 1 (PC1) is loading on income and education dimensions, which are qualitatively aligned with SES. However, Component 2 (PC2) is loading on other potentially relevant dimensions, such as family size and the population under 18. Note the differences below in the districts that surround Fair Haven for both PC1 and PC2.\n\nPCA HeatmapPC1 PeersPC2 Peers\n\n\n\n\nCode\n# Create heatmap\nggplot(loadings_long %&gt;% filter(PC %in% c(\"PC1\", \"PC2\")), aes(x = PC, y = Variable, fill = Loading)) +\n  geom_tile() +\n  scale_fill_gradient2(low = \"blue\", mid = \"white\", high = \"orange\") +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  labs(title = \"PCA Loadings\", x=\"\", y=\"\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Loadings from first two components of the PCA.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClustering\nA final approach to identifying peer districts is cluster analysis. Cluster analysis leverages distance functions to separate districts based on similarity, with the goal of creating groups of high similarity within clusters and high dissimilarity between clusters. I will explore both K-means and hierarchical clustering techniques, looking at a few examples of each.\n\nK-means clusters\nK-means clustering requires a distance matrix as input, and I have already created Euclidean and Mahalanobis distance matrices. I can also apply distance calculations to the PCA results in order to generate clusters based on the reduced dimensionality provided by principal components. Both scaled and un-scaled PCA results are clustered. The un-scaled version should over-weight PC1, and the scaled version should treat PC1 and PC2 more equally. The tabs below show the resulting peer groups from a standard K-means routine that assumes 7 clusters (a full treatment of K-means that searches for the optimal number of clusters is omitted in this document). Each tab includes a list of districts that were clustered alongside Fair Haven given the particular distance matrix as input.\n\n\nCode - K-means clustering\n## distance matrix from earlier\n# Euclidean: edge_dist (557)\n# Mahalanobis: dist_mat_mah (555)\n# PCA: pc_all_scores (needs dist, scaled and unscaled) (555)\n\n# Scale the principal component scores\nscaled_pc_scores &lt;- scale(pc_all_scores[,c(1:2)])\npc_dist_scaled &lt;- dist(scaled_pc_scores)\npc_dist_unscaled &lt;- dist(pc_all_scores[,c(1:2)])\n\n# Apply k-means\nn_clusters &lt;- 6\nkm_pc_scaled &lt;- kmeans(pc_dist_scaled, centers = n_clusters)\nkm_pc_unscaled &lt;- kmeans(pc_dist_unscaled, centers = n_clusters)\nkm_euclid &lt;- kmeans(edge_dist, centers = n_clusters)\nkm_maha &lt;- kmeans(dist_mat_mah, centers = n_clusters)\n\n# Access cluster assignments\nclusters_pc_scaled &lt;- km_pc_scaled$cluster\nclusters_pc_unscaled &lt;- km_pc_unscaled$cluster\nclusters_euclid &lt;- km_euclid$cluster\nclusters_maha &lt;- km_maha$cluster\n\nfh_pc_scaled &lt;- clusters_pc_scaled[\"Fair Haven Borough School District, NJ\"]\nfh_pc_unscaled &lt;- clusters_pc_unscaled[\"Fair Haven Borough School District, NJ\"]\nfh_euclid &lt;- clusters_euclid[fh_leaid]\nfh_maha &lt;- clusters_maha[fh_leaid]\n\nmat_pc_scaled &lt;- as_tibble(names(clusters_pc_scaled[clusters_pc_scaled==fh_pc_scaled])) %&gt;% rename(\"PC Scaled\"=value)\nmat_pc_unscaled &lt;- as_tibble(names(clusters_pc_unscaled[clusters_pc_unscaled==fh_pc_unscaled]))  %&gt;% rename(\"PC Unscaled\"=value)\nmat_euclid &lt;- as_tibble(names(clusters_euclid[clusters_euclid==fh_euclid]))  %&gt;% rename(\"Euclidean\"=value) %&gt;%\n  dplyr::left_join(edge_df %&gt;% dplyr::select(Geography, LEAID) %&gt;% mutate(LEAID=as.character(LEAID)), by = c(\"Euclidean\"=\"LEAID\"))\nmat_maha &lt;- as_tibble(names(clusters_maha[clusters_maha==fh_maha]))  %&gt;% rename(\"Mahalanobis\"=value) %&gt;%\n  dplyr::left_join(edge_df %&gt;% dplyr::select(Geography, LEAID) %&gt;% mutate(LEAID=as.character(LEAID)), by = c(\"Mahalanobis\"=\"LEAID\"))\n\n\n\nEuclideanMahalanobisPC ScaledPC Unscaled\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHierarchical\nAnother clustering strategy is called Hierarchical Clustering, which generates a full tree of districts based on similarity. One advantage of this technique is that one does not have to determine a priori how many clusters there are in the data. The tree can be cut at any level in order to find clusters of appropriate size.\nAs with K-means, the input to the hierarchical clustering routine is a distance matrix. There is another parameter included in the model to instruct how the clustering algorithm should combine districts with each other and with groups. This is often called the “method”, and here will explore a few methods. Again as with K-means, a full treatment of cluster analysis is not provided here. Rather, this exercise is to generate candidate sets of peers that will be qualitatively assessed in the next section.\nThe first tab below shows a partial dendrogram highlighting part of the full tree that contains a decent-sized cluster around Fair Haven. The other two tabs show the resulting peer groups from different clustering inputs.\n\n\nCode - Hierarchical clustering\nfind_min_cluster &lt;- function(hc, target_observation = \"Fair Haven Borough\", min_size = 50, verbose=FALSE) {\n  # Function to find where to cut tree to generate smallest cluster with FH that has at least 50 districts\n  n &lt;- length(hc$labels)\n  min_k &lt;- NULL\n  min_cluster_size &lt;- Inf \n\n  for (k in 2:n) {\n    clusters &lt;- cutree(hc, k = k)\n    target_cluster &lt;- clusters[names(clusters) == target_observation]\n    cluster_members &lt;- names(clusters[clusters == target_cluster])\n    cluster_size &lt;- length(cluster_members)\n\n    if (cluster_size &gt;= min_size && cluster_size &lt; min_cluster_size) {\n      min_k &lt;- k\n      min_cluster_size &lt;- cluster_size\n    }\n  }\n\n  final_clusters &lt;- cutree(hc, k = min_k)\n  \n  \n  if (!is.null(final_clusters)) {\n    \n    # Check the size of the cluster that \"Fair Haven Borough\" belongs to.\n    target_cluster &lt;- final_clusters[names(final_clusters) == target_observation]\n    cluster_members &lt;- names(final_clusters[final_clusters == target_cluster]) # contains peers\n    if (verbose) {\n      print(paste(\"Size of cluster containing Fair Haven Borough:\", length(cluster_members)))\n      print(paste(\"Number of Clusters:\", length(unique(final_clusters))))\n    }\n  } else {\n    if (verbose) print(\"No cluster found with size &gt;= 50 containing Fair Haven Borough.\")\n  }\n\n  \n  if (!is.null(min_k)) {\n    return(list(final_clusters=final_clusters, target_cluster=target_cluster, cluster_members=cluster_members))\n  } else {\n    return(NULL)\n  }\n}\n\n# Distance matrices:\n#   pc_dist_scaled\n#   pc_dist_unscaled\n#   edge_dist\n#   dist_mat_mah (SKIP_)\n\n# Hierarchical clustering using Ward and WPGMA Linkage\n\n## Euclidean\nhc_euclid_ward &lt;- hclust(edge_dist, method = \"ward.D2\" )\nhc_euclid_mcquitty &lt;- hclust(edge_dist, method=\"mcquitty\")\n\nhc_euclid_ward_clusters &lt;- find_min_cluster(hc_euclid_ward, min_size = 50, target_observation = fh_leaid)\nhc_euclid_mcquitty_clusters &lt;- find_min_cluster(hc_euclid_mcquitty, min_size = 50, target_observation = fh_leaid)\n\n## PC scaled\nhc_pc_dist_scaled_ward &lt;- hclust(pc_dist_scaled, method = \"ward.D2\" )\nhc_pc_dist_scaled_mcquitty &lt;- hclust(pc_dist_scaled, method=\"mcquitty\")\n\nhc_pc_dist_scaled_ward_clusters &lt;- find_min_cluster(hc_pc_dist_scaled_ward, min_size = 50, target_observation = \"Fair Haven Borough School District, NJ\")\nhc_pc_dist_scaled_mcquitty_clusters &lt;- find_min_cluster(hc_pc_dist_scaled_mcquitty, min_size = 50, target_observation = \"Fair Haven Borough School District, NJ\")\n\n## PC unscaled\nhc_pc_dist_unscaled_ward &lt;- hclust(pc_dist_unscaled, method = \"ward.D2\" )\nhc_pc_dist_unscaled_mcquitty &lt;- hclust(pc_dist_unscaled, method=\"mcquitty\")\n\nhc_pc_dist_unscaled_ward_clusters &lt;- find_min_cluster(hc_pc_dist_unscaled_ward, min_size = 50, target_observation = \"Fair Haven Borough School District, NJ\")\nhc_pc_dist_unscaled_mcquitty_clusters &lt;- find_min_cluster(hc_pc_dist_unscaled_mcquitty, min_size = 40, target_observation = \"Fair Haven Borough School District, NJ\")\n\n\n\nDendrogramEuclidean Ward PeersPC Unscaled Ward Peers\n\n\n\n\nCode\n# visualize the tree\n# fviz_dend(hc_euclid_ward, k = 4, color_labels_by_k = TRUE, cex=.1, type=\"circular\")\n\nviztree &lt;- function(datain, members, distfun, clustfun) {\n  datain &lt;- datain %&gt;%\n    dplyr::filter(LEAID %in% members)\n  \n  datain_scale &lt;- scale(datain[,-c(1:3)])\n  rownames(datain_scale) &lt;- datain$LEAID\n\n  datain_dist &lt;- dist(datain_scale, method = distfun)\n  \n  newclust &lt;- hclust(datain_dist, method = \"ward.D2\" )\n  newclust$labels &lt;- gsub(\" School District, NJ\", \"\", datain$Geography)\n  \n  fviz_dend(newclust, cex=.4, horiz=T)\n}\n\nviztree(edge_df, hc_euclid_ward_clusters$cluster_members, \"euclidean\", \"ward.D2\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2: Partial dendrogram from Ward clustering (Euclidean)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\nFinally, I add the possible peer sets back to our CCD data set and save them as a CSV file for easy access.\n\n\nCode -

I would like enough districts in the set to provide sufficient variation, but not too many to make comparisons unwieldy - between 35 and 45 should work. Ideally the “Peninsula” peers are already in the set; otherwise I would manually add them in after. It seems like the Hierarchical (Euclidean Ward) set might offer good coverage. A list of these peers can be found above at Section 4.1.4.2, and upon inspection, they do seem reasonable. The group of peers has about 72% of the population with a Bachelor’s degree or higher (FH’s 79%), median household income of $192k (FH’s $230k), and 64% of the population working in management, business, science, or arts (FH’s 60%). From the table, one could argue that that are smaller peer sets that have districts more similar to FH, but I will proceed with the hierarchical cluster-generated solution.\nThis concludes the section on peer set generation for Fair Haven."
