    "text": "Approaches\nI leverage a number of techniques to generate peer districts for Fair Haven using these data. This exercise is both an art and science, as it is both grounded in data and subject to a number of researcher choices. To that end, a few sets of comparison districts will be created. Note that the final comparison data sets will be filtered to only include PK-8 districts like Fair Haven; this will happen later though since it requires yet another data source. In addition, the following section is not a “full academic” treatment of these approaches, meaning that the primary end is to be useful, not necessarily to fully account for all methodological nuances. However, I will compare district characteristics across various peer sets.\n\nEuclidean distance\nOne simple, albeit somewhat naive, approach to identifying peer districts is to find the districts that are “closest” to each other given the district characteristics that were identified above. To do this, I\n\nStandardize all of our variables\nCompute a distance matrix (Euclidean distance in multidimensional space)\nRank districts in terms of their “proximity” to Fair Haven\n\nOne downside to this strategy is that there are a number of highly correlated variables in the data set, and the distance matrix may overweight importance of these characteristics. For example, there are a number of income-based measures, and thus this approach may over-index on the household incomes of district residents. However, it may also produce a reasonable peer set.\n\n\nCode - Using Euclidean distance\n# Standardize variables\nedge_df_scale &lt;- scale(edge_df[,-c(1:3)])\nrownames(edge_df_scale) &lt;- edge_df$LEAID\n\n## compute the distance matrix\nedge_dist &lt;- dist(edge_df_scale, method = \"euclidean\")\n\n# Find the indices of the closest districts\nclosest_indices_euclid &lt;- order(as.matrix(edge_dist)[, which(attr(edge_dist, \"Labels\")==fh_leaid)])\n\n# Reorder edge_df so the most similar districts are on top\nsimilar_districts_euclid &lt;- edge_df[closest_indices_euclid, ] %&gt;% dplyr::mutate(euclid_score=1:n()) %&gt;% dplyr::select(LEAID, Geography, euclid_score)\n\n# Print table\ndatatable(similar_districts_euclid,\n  options = list(\n    pageLength = 10,\n    searching = TRUE,\n    ordering = TRUE\n  ),\n  rownames = FALSE,\n  caption = tags$caption(\n    style = \"caption-side: top; text-align: center;\",\n    \"Most similar districts by Euclidean distance\")\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMahalanobis distance\nA second smiple distance-based approach is to use the Mahalanobis distance, as it is capable of taking into coniderations the correlations present in the data set. To do this, I\n\nStandardize all of our variables\nCompute a distance matrix (Mahalanobis pairwise distances)\nRank districts in terms of their “proximity” to Fair Haven\n\n\n\nCode - Using Mahalanobis distance\n# Standardize variables\nedge_df_scale &lt;- scale(edge_df[,-c(1:3)])\nrownames(edge_df_scale) &lt;- edge_df$LEAID\n\nmahalanobis_dist_matrix &lt;- function(data) {\n  cov_matrix &lt;- cov(data)\n  n &lt;- nrow(data)\n  dist_matrix &lt;- matrix(0, nrow = n, ncol = n)\n\n  for (i in 1:n) {\n    for (j in 1:n) {\n      dist_matrix[i, j] &lt;- mahalanobis(data[i, ], data[j, ], cov_matrix)\n    }\n  }\n  return(dist_matrix)\n}\n\n## compute the distance matrix\ndist_mat_mah &lt;- mahalanobis_dist_matrix(na.omit(edge_df_scale))\nrownames(dist_mat_mah) &lt;- dimnames(na.omit(edge_df_scale))[[1]]\n\n# Find the indices of the closest districts\nclosest_indices_mah &lt;- order(as.matrix(dist_mat_mah)[, which(rownames(dist_mat_mah)==fh_leaid)])\n\n# Print the most similar districts\nsimilar_districts_mah &lt;- (edge_df %&gt;% dplyr::filter(LEAID %in% rownames(dist_mat_mah))) [closest_indices_mah, ] %&gt;% dplyr::mutate(mah_score=1:n()) %&gt;% dplyr::select(LEAID, Geography, mah_score)\n\n# Print table\ndatatable(similar_districts_mah,\n  options = list(\n    pageLength = 10,\n    searching = TRUE,\n    ordering = TRUE\n  ),\n  rownames = FALSE,\n  caption = tags$caption(\n    style = \"caption-side: top; text-align: center;\",\n    \"Most similar districts by Mahalanobis distance\")\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrincipal Components\nAnother strategy for identifying peer districts is a dimensionality reduction technique called Principal Components Analysis. This is actually the same technique used to develop the original District Factor Groups. Though here I am using more data and more recent data. The central idea is to reduce our 40-dimensional (40-column) data set into a smaller set of components (or dimensions) that are maximally different from each other and uncorrelated with each other. These new components would contain the essence of the larger set of columns. As in the DFG calculation, I expect the first principal component to contain the variance associated with socioeconomic status (SES).\nThe general procedure is to:\n\nCompute the principal components on the data set\nAssess which dimensions load in which principal components\nRank order component of interest, and find districts surrounding Fair Haven\n\nIf the first one or two components is not sufficient, we are in clustering territory, which will be addressed later.\n\n\nCode - Using Principal Components\n# Perform PCA\npcadat &lt;- na.omit(edge_df[,-c(1:3)])\nrownames(pcadat) &lt;- make.unique(na.omit(edge_df)$Geography)\npca_result &lt;- prcomp(pcadat, scale.=T, center = T)\n\n#round(pca_result$sdev^2/sum(pca_result$sdev^2), 2) #first two ~49% variance, 37+12\n\n# Extract principal components\npc_all_scores &lt;- pca_result$x\n\n#Visualize the reduced data\n#autoplot(pca_result, data = pcadat, label = TRUE, label.size = 3)\n\n# Get loadings\npca_loadings &lt;- pca_result$rotation\n\n# Transform loadings into a long format data frame\nloadings_df &lt;- as.data.frame(pca_loadings)\nloadings_df$Variable &lt;- rownames(pca_loadings)\nloadings_long &lt;- reshape2::melt(loadings_df, id.vars = \"Variable\", variable.name = \"PC\", value.name = \"Loading\")\n\n\nIn Figure 1, it is clear that Component 1 (PC1) is loading on income and education dimensions, which are qualitatively aligned with SES. However, Component 2 (PC2) is loading on other potentially relevant dimensions, such as family size and the population under 18. Note the differences below in the districts that surround Fair Haven for both PC1 and PC2.\n\nPCA HeatmapPC1 PeersPC2 Peers\n\n\n\n\nCode\n# Create heatmap\nggplot(loadings_long %&gt;% filter(PC %in%

Cluster analysis leverages distance functions to separate districts based on similarity, with the goal of creating groups of high similarity within clusters and high dissimilarity between clusters. I will explore both K-means and hierarchical clustering techniques, looking at a few examples of each.\n\nK-means clusters\nK-means clustering requires a distance matrix as input, and we have already created Euclidean and Mahalanobis distance matrices. The PCA results from earlier can also be converted to distance matrix and thus clustered. Both scaled and un-scaled PCA results are clustered. The un-scaled version should over-weight PC1, and the scaled version should treat PC1 and PC2 more equally. The tab set below shows the resulting peer groups from a relatively simple K-means routine, assuming 10 clusters.\n\n\nCode - K-means clustering\n## distance matrix from earlier\n# Euclidean:

    "text": "We moved to Fair Haven in early 2021 during the Pandemic in search of a family-oriented community down the shore with excellent schools and in commuting distance to NYC. Fair Haven certainly fit the bill. Fast forward a few years and we are fully integrated into the FH community, with a first grader and pre-K-er both at Sickles.\nProfessionally, I spent the first half of my career working in education and related industries. During college, I worked as a research assistant at the Cornell Higher Education Research Institute (CHERI) studying determinants of faculty productivity. Shortly after, I spent a year at a policy evaluation firm measuring the impacts of federally funded early childhood centers. I then entered graduate school at Teachers College, Columbia University to pursue a degree in economics and education while working at the Community College Research Center (CCRC). A few years in, I decided that I needed some more grounded experience, and took two years off to be a mathematics and statistics teacher at a growing American school in Cancún, Mexico. I eventually returned to New York City and Columbia to finish graduate school before venturing out into the world of EdTech, where I worked as a researcher and data scientist at several startups. I’ve since left the education world professionally, but am still focused on research, data, and decision-making as a quantitative user experience researcher at a global technology company.\nAs I have been following the current Fair Haven district budget situation, and thinking about the long-term investments that me and my family are making in the community, it seemed like a natural next step to get more involved and to contribute a data-drive, outcome-oriented voice to these important issues facing our community and schools. It’s almost as if I have been preparing my whole life for this opportunity, and I am excited to get started.\nFor more info, check out my resume or Google Scholar profile."

Crosta, and I’m running for the Fair Haven Board of Education in 2025 because I believe in a data-driven, outcome-oriented approach to ensuring the best possible education for all Fair Haven students.\n[photo coming!]\nBorn and raised in New Jersey, I spent formative summers on the Bayshore before making Fair Haven home in 2021 with my wife, Sarah, and our two children (ages 4 and 7) who are currently enrolled at Sickles Elementary School. I have expertise in educational evaluation and policy analysis, having earned a PhD in economics of education from Columbia University, and I spent a decade conducting research on higher-ed institutions serving diverse student populations. My vision for Fair Haven schools is to ensure every child has access to a high-quality education that prepares them for success in a rapidly-changing world. My research has given me a deep understanding of resource allocation challenges in educational settings, which will be invaluable in addressing Fair Haven’s budget constraints and ensuring all students have the support they need. Beyond my professional experience, I also volunteer on the board of Fair Haven Rec Soccer. When not enjoying the beach with my family or watching the kids play soccer at Fair Haven fields, I work as a user experience researcher for a global technology company."
