As part of my commitment to being data-driven and outcome-oriented, I'll share examples of research, data analysis, and related insights on this page.

-   [Building a dataset](research/building_a_dataset.html): combining education data from state and federal sources; creation of a set of peer districts for Fair Haven.
-   [Enrollment Trends](research/enrollment_trends.qmd): short doc showcasing enrollment trends for Fair Haven and peer districts from 2011-12 to 2023-24.
-   [Standardized Test Scores](research/test%20scores.md) (TODO)
-   [Inputs](research/inputs.md) (TODO)
